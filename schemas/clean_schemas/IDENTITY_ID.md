**Source:** https://datahandbook.epic.com/ClarityDictionary/Details?tblName=IDENTITY_ID

## Description

The IDENTITY_ID table contains the system master person index ID numbers for your patients. Each patient may have multiple master person index IDs; therefore, a line number is used to identify each identification number for a patient.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PAT_ID | VARCHAR (18) | The unique ID assigned to the patient record internally and links to the patient table. This ID may be encrypted if you have elected to use enterprise reporting?s encryption utility. |
| LINE | No | The line number of the patient ID within the patient?s record. |
| IDENTITY_ID | VARCHAR (100) | The identification number associated with the patient. This ID may be encrypted. NOTE: This is the identification number that corresponds to the IDENTITY_TYPE_ID column listed in this same record. |
| IDENTITY_TYPE_ID | NUMERIC (18,0) | The system master person index ID type corresponding to this identification number for the patient. Master person index distinguishes ID numbers from different locations and service areas based on their type. Type can also be used to designate non-system IDs to be populated and used to interface with data from other systems. |
| CM_PHY_OWNER_ID | VARCHAR (25) | ID of the physical deployment owner for this record.  Physical owners will be where the data is hosted, either on the cross-over server or the owner deployment. |
| CM_LOG_OWNER_ID | VARCHAR (25) | ID of the logical deployment owner for this record.  Logical owners show the deployment where the record was created but doesn't represent if the record is a part of version skew. |
| EPI_FROM_DATE | DATETIME | This column contains the first date on which the Identity IDs became effective. |
| EPI_TO_DATE | DATETIME | This column contains the date on which the Identity ID becomes no longer effective. |
| MPI_RET_CHK_PP_ID | NUMERIC (18,0) | MPI Retrieval check extension. |
| MPI_RET_CHK_RULE_ID | VARCHAR (18) | MPI Retrieval check rule. |
| EPI_CHT_LOC_ID | VARCHAR (18) | The chart location for the patient record. |
