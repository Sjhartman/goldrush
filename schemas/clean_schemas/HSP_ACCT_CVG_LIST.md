| CVG_TIMELY_FILING_DATE | DATETIME | This item stores the timely filing date for the coverage. The date is updated as the HAR changes and remains populated after the HAR is closed for reporting purposes. The date stamped is the earliest timely filing date from any active, non-closed buckets for this coverage. If no buckets are active, for primary coverages the prebilled bucket is used to calculate the expected timely filing. For secondary coverages with non active buckets, the NRP deadline is used from the previous coverage. |
