## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PAT_ENC_CSN_ID | NUMERIC (18,0) | The unique contact serial number for this contact. This number is unique across all patient encounters in your system. If you use IntraConnect, this is the Unique Contact Identifier (UCI). |
| PAT_ID | VARCHAR (18) | The unique ID assigned to the patient record (EPT .1). This ID may be encrypted if you have elected to use enterprise reporting?s security utility. |
| PAT_ENC_DATE_REAL | No | A unique, internal contact date in decimal format. The integer portion of the number indicates the date of the contact. The digits after the decimal distinguish different contacts on the same date and are unique for each contact on that date. For example, .00 is the first/only contact, .01 is the second contact, etc. |
| CONTACT_DATE | DATETIME | The date of this contact in calendar format. |
| CM_CT_OWNER_ID | VARCHAR (25) | The Community ID (CID) of the instance that owns this contact. This is populated only if you use IntraConnect. |
